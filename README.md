# Ricardo Calderon – Portfolio Repository

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of the projects, papers, and analyses I’ve worked on as part of my studies, research, and independent exploration. It highlights my interests in **data science, machine learning, signal processing, and applied research**, as well as my ability to build end-to-end workflows from raw data to polished deliverables.

## Contents

The repository is organized into subfolders by project or paper:

- **Data Analysis** – Exploratory and applied analyses using real-world datasets (e.g., economic data, disaster impacts, library usage).

- **Signal Processing** – Research on electromyography (EMG) data, prosthetic control, and advanced filtering techniques.

Each folder contains its own README with background, methodology, results, and references.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, SQL, LaTeX

- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Altair, PyTorch/JAX, scikit-learn
